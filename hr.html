    <p>Born in Rosario, Argentina, in 1987, Lionel Messi is widely regarded as one of the greatest football players of all time, and his illustrious career proves why. The Argentinean footballer, who holds a record eight Ballon d'Or awards, has displayed his talent early on and has always been destined for greatness.</p>
    <p id="d">When Messi was 13 years old, he and his family moved to Barcelona, where the club assisted him in treating his growth hormone deficiency. He started playing for FC Barcelona's U14 team. The Argentinean quickly rose through the ranks, impressing everyone with exceptional skills and talent. At 17, he made his first senior appearance for the club and became a vital player for the Blaugranas.
    
        The Rosario's native relationship with Barcelona has been very successful. During his 17-year career with the team, he helped them win numerous titles, including 10 La Liga titles, four Champions League crowns, and seven Copa del Rey trophies. He is also the all-time leading scorer in La Liga, with an incredible 474 goals to his name. He left the Spanish club in 2021 to join French powerhouse Paris Saint Germain, where he played two years before joining Inter Miami in the MLS.
